In this code we create a variable of constant type called NFTS.Then we pass some parameters to this function like name, UID, and address.Then we create a loop that will go through an array of this function.And then we print their metadata with console.log().As console.log is a method in JavaScript used to log (print) output in the browser console.Then print the total number of NFTS and atlast we call three function like name=Apurva,UID = 22BCS16215and Address= Jammu and so on.
